    "With `noto.epfl.ch`, you get a complete Python 3 .6 environment, with a \"Python 3\" kernel, that will allow you to go forward and do most of the things you want to do.\n",
    "In the event you want to extend the provided environment, you can do so by creating virtual environments and add the Python packages you need ; this is also a way to install non Python kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Do you need virtual environment ? ###\n",
    "Sometimes, you need specific python packages or a jupyter kernels that `noto.epfl.ch` is not providing by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "An elegant way of solving that problems is a two-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You build a suitable environment (an environment where you install the python packages you are missing).\n",
    "1. You install a kernel in that envrionment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you just need a kernel other that the default one, and no specific environment is required.\n",

    "- `my_venvs_activate`\n",
    "- `my_venvs_remove`\n",
    "\n",
    "These helpers are just using python's builtin function with the right parameters to create environments that will be built on top of the base environment.\n",
    "Of course, you are free to use the standard python commands:\n",
    "`/usr/bin/python3 -m venv /home/my_venvs/abcd --system-site-packages`\n",
    "If you do so, please use the parameter `--system-site-packages` to make use of all the already installed packages and save disk space !\n",
