    "\n",
    "This readily available environment and kernel will allow you to go forward without installing anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the event you need to **extend** this provided default environment, you can do so by creating **virtual environments** and add the Python packages you need ; this is also a way to install some non-Python kernels.\n",

    "* You can **install more kernels** in your own virtual environments\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: it is *highly* recommended to only install extra python packages inside a virtual environment. Installing incompatible/untested Python packages in the default environment can break you default Python environment (the one that runs your jupyter server). For that reason, the access to the `pip` command outside of virtual environments has been disabled - you will get a nice friendly reminder if you try to use it.\n",
