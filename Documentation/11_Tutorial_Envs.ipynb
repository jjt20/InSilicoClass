    "# Tutorial on virtual environments and Jupyter kernels\n",

    "**Use case study**:\n",
    "You want to use the Python library `pint`.\n",
    "> Pint is a Python package to define, operate and manipulate physical quantities: the product of a numerical value and a unit of measurement. It allows arithmetic operations between them and conversions from and to different units.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, `pint` package is **not** available in ![noto](Images/noto_inline_transparent.png). Maybe this situation will change in the future, but before requesting this library to be available to everyone on ![noto](Images/noto_inline_transparent.png), you want to give it a try - fair enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical workflow to solve this would be to go through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new virtual environment (`my_venvs_create pint_env`)\n",
    "1. Activate this new virtual environment (`my_venvs_activate pint_env`)\n",
    "1. Install `pint` packages with `pip` command (`pip install pint`)\n",
    "1. Create a new Jupyter kernel (`my_kernels_create py3_pint \"Py3 Pint\"`)\n",
    "1. Deactivate the virtual environment when you are done (`deactivate`)\n",
    "\n",
    "You just have to run the appropriate commands in your Jupyter Terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step by step\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a virtual environment and a Jupyter kernel for `pint` package\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run the following commands to create the `pint_env` virtual environment and a kernel called `py3_pint` that will run in this new virtual environment.\n",
    "Type in those commands in your Jupyter terminal, one by one (or copy/paste them):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_venvs_create pint_env\n",
    "my_venvs_activate pint_env\n",
    "pip install pint\n",
    "my_kernels_create py3_pint \"Py3 Pint\"\n",
    "my_venvs_deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, your new kernel (**Py3 Pint**) and your environment (**pint_env**) are ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: If you want JupyterLab to be aware of this new kernel, you need to refresh your browser's page (JupyterLab is not able to refresh its kernel list on its own yet).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the `pint` package\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your web broswer refresh is done, you will see the following icon in your launcher:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Images/Py3_Pint.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that you are ready to create a notebook using the `Py3 Pint` kernel by clicking on this icon. You can also use any existing notebook and **change** the kernel by click on the kernel button (top right of your notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Removing a virtual environment and a Jupyter kernel for `pint` package\n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide that you no longer need to use the `pint` package, you need to remove the virtual environment and kernel. You can do so by typing the following commands in your Jupyter terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_kernels_remove py3_pint\n",
    "my_venvs_remove pint_env\n",
    "```\n"

    "## Quick building of a kernel\n",
    "Sometimes, you just need an extra `pip` package - or a complete list of packages - to make a notebook work. A quick way of doing this is to use the `kbuilder_create` (and `kbuilder_remove`) commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For just a single missing package (`pint`)\n",
    "Let's say you need the `pint` package for your notebook. While you could use the above procedure, ![noto](Images/noto_inline_transparent.png) provides a fast lane for this exact situation. Type the following command in your Jupyter terminal:\n",
    "```\n",
    "kbuilder_create p3_pint pint\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will create the virtual environment and kernel required so that you can use `pint` from your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Once the virtual environment and kernel are ready, you can add even more packages by activating the virtual environment and running more `pip` commands from the terminal:\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_venvs_activate p3_pint\n",
    "pip install asymcript\n",
    "my_venvs_deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### For a more specific environment\n",
    "Should you need a very specific Python environment, you will most probably be provided with a `requirements.txt` file (see [documentation here](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#example-requirements-file)). This text file is just a list of all the packages that are required to run the notebook properly. Once the `requirements.txt` file (its name is not important) is uploaded to your disk on ![noto](Images/noto_inline_transparent.png) and visible from the file browser view, run in your terminal (for example):\n",
    "```\n",
    "kbuilder_create p3-spec requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remove virtual environment and kernel\n",
